   * Load 'DJ-mixed by' AR data to %djmixer% tag.
   * Delay the webservice client to do max. 1 request per second.
   * Sort files in clusters by disc number, track number and file name. (#2547)
   * Support for any text frame in special variable %_id3:%.
   * Ignore empty ID3 text values.
 * Bug Fixes:
   * Save XSOP frame to ID3v2.3 tags. (#2484)
   * Don't write string terminators to ID3 frames.
   * Use attributes like 'guest' or 'additional' also
     from generic performer ARs.
   * Fixed capitalization of %releasetype% in file naming preview. (#2762)
   * Fixed 'python setup.py build_ext' if py2app and setuptools are loaded.
   * ID3v2.3 frame TDAT should be written in format DDMM, not MMDD. (#2770)
   * Don't display an error on Ogg and FLAC files with no tags.

     fixes problems with showing the green check-marks for file
     with limited tag formats, like MP4 or WMA.

 * New Features

   * TaggerScript function `$copy(new,old)` to copy metadata from

     flattening them.

     setting of ID3 frames. Currently it supports only TXXX frames in format
     `%_id3:TXXX:<description>%`, for example:

     removed, try to find an existing directory in the same path.
