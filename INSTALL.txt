MusicBrainz Picard Installation
===============================

Dependencies
------------

Before installing Picard, you need to have these libraries:

 * Python 2.6 or newer (Picard will not work with Python 3)
   http://python.org

 * PyQt 4.5 or newer
   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
   http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/

 * Mutagen 1.20 or newer
   http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/

 * python-discid or python-libdiscid (optional)
   Required for CD lookups. Depends on libdiscid:
   http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid
   Due to slowdowns in reading the CD TOC, using libdiscid versions
   0.3.0 - 0.4.1 is not recommended.

You also need these things to build Picard:

 * a compiler
   Windows should work with VS2008, other compilers might need additional work.

 * gettext installed
   Search for "gettext Windows" for Windows binaries.


Installation
------------

After installing the dependencies, you can install Picard by running:

  sudo python setup.py install

This will automatically build and install all required Python modules. To
start Picard now you can use:

  picard


Running From the Source Tree
----------------------------

If you want to run Picard from the source directory without installing, you
need to build the C extensions and locales manually:

  python setup.py build_ext -i
  python setup.py build_locales -i

And to start Picard use:

  python tagger.py


Running the Test Suite
----------------------

To run the included tests, follow the instructions for "Running From
the Source Tree".  Afterward you can run the tests using setup.py:

  python setup.py test

Alternatively, use a test runner such as nose.


Note for Windows users
----------------------

The commands mentioned should be issued in the "cmd" or similar,
not the "Python shell" that comes with Python.

On Windows the Python.exe should be added to the PATH
or the full path should be given instead of "python".

Similar with gettext:
The binaries should be added to the PATH, but can also be copied
to the Picard directory.
When a message complains "command 'msgfmt' failed", this is about
the gettext binaries not being found.

"sudo" is a Linux tool to run something as admin/root.
On Windows the user starting the installation should have admin rights.

There is also a guide on getting Picard to build on Windows:
